## üõ†Ô∏è Assignment Questions and Workflow

### Q.1: Implementing Square Root Feature in CalculatorPlus

#### Task:
- Implement a new feature for calculating the square root of a number.

#### Steps:
1. Create a repository named `git_assignment_HeroVired`.
2. Create a `dev` branch and add the following code:

```python
import math

class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
    
    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b
    
    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b
    
    def divide(self, a, b):
        return a / b

    # TODO: Implement square root function
    def square_root(self, x):
        return math.sqrt(x)
```

3. Merge `dev` into `main` and release `v1` of CalculatorPlus.
4. Add a collaborator.
5. Create a `feature/sqrt` branch to add the `sqrt` function.
6. Address a critical bug in the `divide` function:

```python
def divide(self, a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
    return a / b
```

7. Merge changes, request a review, and release `v2`.

### Q.2: Handling Large Files with Git LFS

#### Task:
- Integrate Git LFS to handle large binary files efficiently.

#### Steps:
1. Create a `lfs` branch in `git_assignment_HeroVired`.
2. Install Git LFS and track large files:

```sh
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.bin"
```

3. Upload and push a file over 200MB.
4. Clone on another machine to verify.

### Q.3: Geometry Calculator Using Git Stash

#### Task:
- Implement a Python program for calculating area of a circle and a rectangle.

#### Steps:
1. Create a `geometry-calculator` branch.
2. Work on `circle-area` feature in a new branch:

```python
class GeometryCalculator:
    def calculate_circle_area(self, radius):
        return math.pi * radius ** 2
```

3. Stash changes and switch to `rectangle-area` branch.
4. Implement rectangle area function:

```python
def calculate_rectangle_area(self, length, width):
    return length * width
```

5. Retrieve stashed changes and finalize both features.
6. Push, create pull requests, review, and merge into `main`.
